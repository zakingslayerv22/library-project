# library-project

The library project is a project that let's us try our hands on object constructors, objects and prototypes. 

It is a simple project that receives user input, creates a new instance of an object based off that input, and displays it on the page as a 'book'.

The user can toggle the read status and remove the book from the library. As simple as the project seems, there is a lot to learn in the process of building it. Arrays turn out to be quite useful in javascript and they come in handy in this project. I learned recursive function calls and how blissful they can be if you do not get too carried away to forget to set a base condition. A function calling itself within its body? Hey, that's cheating!

We have been informed that we might revisit this project and add some features to it. I'm looking forward to it.

I have to go back to the course work.

I'll see you around.

Ã€ plus tard!
